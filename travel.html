                <b>Day 1-2:</b> The Discovery of the Manuscript<br>
                
                Professor Otto Lidenbrock, an eminent geologist living in Hamburg, discovers an ancient manuscript during a visit to a bookseller. Intrigued by its enigmatic content, he decides to take it home to study it more closely. With the help of his nephew Axel, a young man passionate about science and his faithful assistant, the professor begins to decipher the encrypted text of the manuscript.
                The first clues reveal that the manuscript contains information about an extraordinary journey, a journey to the center of the Earth. The professor, driven by scientific curiosity and the ambition of a historic discovery, decides to follow the instructions in the manuscript and undertake this daring expedition. Axel, although reluctant at first due to the potential dangers, is eventually convinced to join his uncle on this epic adventure.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 3-5:</b> Preparations for the Expedition<br>
                
                Professor Lidenbrock, Axel and their faithful servant, Hans Bjelke, begin preparations for their trip to Iceland, the starting point indicated by the manuscript. They gather necessary supplies, including food, tools, camping equipment and warm clothing to face the harsh conditions of the volcanic island.
                Meanwhile, the professor continues to decipher the manuscript, discovering new clues about the stages of the expedition. Axel, for his part, feels a mixture of excitement and apprehension at the idea of embarking on this uncertain adventure, but he is determined to support his uncle in his scientific quest.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 6-10:</b> Arrival in Iceland<br>
                
                The trio finally arrives in Iceland after a boat trip from Hamburg. They disembark in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland, where they are greeted by majestic landscapes of volcanoes, glaciers and desolate plains. They then head to Sneffels, the extinct volcano where they plan to begin their descent into the depths of the Earth.
                Along the way, they meet local people, learn about Icelandic customs and soak up the unique atmosphere of this isolated island. They also hire Hans Bjelke, an experienced Icelandic guide, to accompany them on their expedition and help them navigate Iceland's wild and rugged landscapes.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 11-20:</b> The descent into the Sneffels<br>
                
                The day of the descent finally approaches, and the trio is full of anticipation and nervousness. Equipped with ropes, flashlights and other climbing equipment, they prepare to descend into the Sneffels crater. Professor Lidenbrock, as leader of the expedition, takes the lead, followed closely by Axel and Hans.
                The descent into the volcano is a grueling ordeal, filled with challenges and dangers. They must overcome obstacles such as steep rock walls, narrow passages and rock slides. Temperatures become colder and colder as they descend deeper into the bowels of the Earth, and they must protect themselves against cold and exhaustion.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 21-30:</b> Discoveries and Difficulties<br>
                
                During their descent into the Sneffels, the trio makes a series of fascinating discoveries. They find fossils of prehistoric creatures, strange rock formations and unique geological phenomena. They record their observations in a logbook and collect samples for scientific study.
                However, the journey is far from easy. They encounter difficulties such as blocked passages, rock slides and extreme weather conditions. They must demonstrate perseverance, ingenuity and courage to overcome every obstacle in their path.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 31-40:</b> The Underground Ocean<br>
                
                After days of exploration in the depths of Sneffels, the trio finally reaches a huge underground ocean. They construct a crude raft from tree trunks and ropes, and launch into the dark, mysterious waters of the ocean.
                Sailing the underground ocean, they encounter strange and prehistoric sea creatures, such as ichthyosaurs and pterodactyls. They also discover exotic plants and astonishing rock formations, which bear witness to the richness and diversity of this hidden world.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 41-50:</b> At the Center of the Earth<br>
                
                After days of exploring the underground ocean, the trio finally reaches the center of the Earth. There, they discover an astonishing and fantastical landscape, populated by exotic plants, prehistoric creatures and strange rock formations.
                They explore this strange and wonderful world, recording their observations and collecting samples for scientific study. They also uncover clues about Earth's geology and climatology, which could have important implications for our understanding of our planet.
                However, their time in the center of the Earth is limited, as they must soon begin their journey back to the surface. But before leaving, they take the time to admire the wonders of this underground world, knowing that they are the first human beings to ever explore it.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 51-60:</b> The Return<br>
                
                The journey back to the surface is just as perilous as the descent. The trio must face new challenges, including geothermal storms, blocked passages and rock slides. But with determination and ingenuity, they overcome every obstacle in their path.
                They use their experience, scientific knowledge and teamwork to navigate through dangers and difficulties. They encourage each other, support each other in difficult times and share their joy when the moment of victory finally comes.<br><br>
                
                <b>Day 61 and following:</b> Return to the Surface<br>
                
                After days of effort and sacrifice, the trio finally manages to return to the surface, emerging from the Sneffels and finding the light of day. They are greeted by the sunlight, fresh air and majestic landscape of Iceland.
